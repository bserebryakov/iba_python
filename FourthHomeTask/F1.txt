1. Earth life, having passed halfway,
2. I found myself in a gloomy forest,
3. Having lost the right path in the darkness of the valley.
4. What he was, oh, how I will pronounce,
5. That wild forest, dense and threatening,
6. Whose old horror in my memory I carry!
7. He is so bitter that death is almost sweeter.
8. But, having found blessing in him forever,
9. I will say about everything that I saw in this more often.
10. I do not remember myself how I entered there,
11. So a dream enmeshed me with lies,
12. When I am off track.
